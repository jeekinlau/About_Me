# Jeekin Lau: About Me 
	
	

## Bio:
I am a postdoc  at Texas A&M University in the Horticultural Sciences Department. I got my B.S. and M.S. at Auburn University in the Department of Horticulture. My emphasis of study in my B.S. was Fruit and Vegetable Production and in my M.S. program I worked for a pesticide efficacy lab. I recieved my PhD at Texas A&M Univeristy working on Tetraploid Garden rose bi-parental mapping populations used for the study of disease and architectural traits.

## Research Interests
                      
### Master's of Science, Auburn Univeristy, Department of Horticulture					  
During my Master's Degree, I focused on the pesticide efficacy of many herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. The type of research I was extensively involved in was the application of the pesticide, followed by the evaluation of plant health, insect larva and adult counts, phyto-toxicity, and harvest data.    
For my Master's Thesis I investigated the use of industrial sweetpotato's fermentation byproduct as a potential livestock feed for protein content. During this study I was exposed to the use of HPLC and had to delve into animal nutrition.
             
### PhD, Texas A&M Univeristy, Department of Horticultural Sciences			 
During my PhD, I developed two tetraploid garden rose bi-parental mapping populations which were used for the study of disease (black spot, cercospora, rose rosette, and defoliation) and architectural traits (primary shoots, plant size, apical dominance). These populations were genotyped with the WagRhSNP 68k Axiom array. Linkage maps were constructed and QTL studies were done with the aforementioned traits. Both GWAS-like (Single marker regression) and interval mapping methods were used for QTL scans. My PhD work was funded by United States Department of Agriculture, Specialty Crops Research Initiative (USDA, SCRI) grant “Combatting Rose Rosette Disease: Short and Long Term Approaches” Grant No. 2014-51181-22644
           
### Postdoc, Texas A&M Univeristy, Department of Horticultural Sciences	
During my postdoc at Texas A&M Univeristy, I was tasked with comparing many new genetic tools developed as a part of a USDA SCRI "Tools for Polyploids" Grant No. 2020-51181-32156
